<h2>Example of Generating and Interpreting a GNN</h2>

<p>This section provides an example of how EFI-GNT can be used to discover
metabolic pathways.Although this example is "simple", it illustrates the
strategy for using a GNN generated for an SSN cluster to identify functionally
linked enzymes in pathways.</p>

<p>The EFI developed a strategy for discovering the in vitro activities and in
vivo physiological functions (roles in metabolic pathways) of uncharacterized
microbial enzymes (Biochemistry2015,54, 909-931). This strategy uses the solute
binding proteins (SBPs; periplasmic in Gram-negative organisms and
extracellular in Gram-positive organisms) of ABC and TRAP transport system to
guide the discovery of the enzymes/pathway responsible for catabolism of the
transported ligand. High-throughput/large-scale protein production and
experimental ligand screening (using libraries of potential ligands) is used to
identify the ligand for the SBP. Then, SSNs generated by the EFI-EST web tool
and GNNs generated by the EFI-GNT are used to identify the pathway components
as well as transcriptional regulators and other transport system components.</p>

<p>ABC transporters are the most abundant transport system, with multiple families
of SBPs curated by Pfam. Some are curated as specific for carbohydrates, others
for amino acids and peptides, and others for other small molecules/ions. These
can be expected to provide a rich source of novel pathways for functional
discovery and characterization.</p>

<p>The EFI’s strategy was initiated using the smaller TRAP transport system; it
has a single Pfam-curated family of SBPs (PF03480). Many of the ligands for the
TRAP transporters are anionic, carboxylates or phosphate esters, although
exceptions have been discovered (vide infra).</p>

<h3>Generating the input file for EFI-GNT: SSN for TRAP SBPs (PF03480)</h3>

<p>The InterPro 58/UniProt 2016_06 database contained 19,503 sequences for TRAP
SBPs (PF03480). Option B of EFI-EST was used to generate the SSN. When the SSN
is filtered with an alignment score of 120 (~60% sequence identity), many of
the clusters are "isofunctional" (Figure 1).</p>

<p><img src='images/tutorial/example_figure_1.jpg' width='600'></p>

<p><i>Figure 1.</i> SSN for PF03480</p>

<p>Ethanolamine (EAL) was discovered as a ligand for a TRAP SBP
from Chromohalobacter salexigens (UniProt ID Q1QZR9; Biochemistry 2015,54, 909-
931). Using the Select Control Panel and searching the <b>name</b> node attribute,
Q1QZR9 can be located in a cluster in the SSN (red node in the circled cluster
in Figure 1). All of the nodes in the cluster can be selected with the cursor
and a daughter SSN containing only the family of EAL-binding SBPs can be
generated (Figure 2) using the "New Network from Selection" tool at the top of
the Cytoscape window.</p>

<p><img src='images/tutorial/example_figure_2.jpg' width='600'></p>

<p><i>Figure 2.</i> Daughter SSN for Q1QZR9 cluster</p>


<p>The .xgmml file for this cluster is the input for EFI-GNT; it is obtained as
follows:</p>

<p>Under the File Menu, "Network" is selected in the "Export" submenu. In the
"Export Network" window that opens, select XGMML (.xgmml, .xml) as the export
file format. Then Save the Network by Browsing to locate the folder in which
you would like to save the file, e.g., the folder that contains the Cytoscape
session file for the SSN. This XGMML file is the input for EFI-GNT that will be
used to identify the components of the catabolic pathway for EAL.</p>

<h3>EFI-GNT Start Page: Uploading the XGMML File and Setting Parameters for
Neighbor Collection</h3>

<p><b>Input SSN:</b> The Start page for EFI-GNT (button at the bottom of this page; http:
//efi.igb.illinois.edu/gnt-test/stepa.php) is used to upload the XGMML file for
the EAL cluster. This file is selected using the Choose File function (Figure
3).</p>

<p><img src='images/tutorial/submission_form.png' width='100%'></p>
<p><i>Figure 3.</i> EFI-GNT Start/Upload Page</p>

<p><b>Genome neighborhood size:</b> EFI-GNT uses a default window size of &plusmn;10 orfs to
locate genome neighbors. As noted in a previous section, the signal to noise in
the GNN increases as the window size decreases. If desired, the user can select
a different window size from (&#177;3 to &#177;20 orfs) on the menu on the Start page.</p>

<p><b>Co-occurrence frequency:</b> EFI-GNT uses a default 20% lower limit for the co-occurrence frequency of SSN queries and their GNN neighbors to include members
of a neighborhood Pfam family in the GNN. As the co-occurrence frequency
increases, the signal to noise in the GNN should increase, i.e., functionally
unlinked Pfam families present in the genome neighborhood occur with low co-
occurrence frequencies if a diverse phylogenetic set of query sequences is
present in the input SSN. For the beginning user, we recommend using the 20%
default value.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the GNN can be generated with a small co-occurrence frequency,
e.g., 5%, and filtered using the Select Control Panel at larger values of
the Co-occurrence node attribute for the spoke-nodes. In the Pfam hub-node format
GNN, this will identify the SSN query clusters associated with the selected co-
occurrence frequencies; in the cluster hub-node format GNN, this will identify
the Pfam families associated with the selected co-occurrence frequencies. The
user then can select the directly connected hub-nodes in the Select/Node menu
and generate the more stringent daughter GNN in a new network window (thereby
preserving the original GNN).</p>

<p>[Alternatively, the user can filter the GNN using the Select Control Panel at
range of values below the desired limit and delete the selected spoke-nodes. If
a selected spoke-node is the only spoke-node in the cluster, the directly
connected hub-node also should be selected for deletion. However, this will
destroy the original GNN.]</p>

<p>Finally, the user enters his/her e-mail address; EFI-GNT sends an e-mail to
this address when the GNN has been generated and is available for download.</p>

<h3>Download Page: Colored SSN and GNN XGMML Files and Tab/Spreadsheet Files</h3>

<p>As described in previous sections, EFI-GNT generates one SSN file and two GNN
files.</p>

<p>The SSN isa colored version of the input SSN in which the nodes in each cluster
are colored with the unique color.</p>

<p>The GNN is generated in two formats:</p>

<p>In the first GNN format, a cluster is present for each query SSN cluster (hub-
node) that was used to identify genome neighbors (spoke-nodes).This format
allows the user to identify functionally linked enzymes, as deduced from genome
proximity, that constitute the metabolic pathway in which the sequences in the
query SSN cluster participate.</p>

<p>In the second GNN format, a cluster is present for each Pfam family (hub-node)
that was identified as a neighbor to queries in the SSN clusters (spoke-
nodes).This format allows the user to assess whether queries in multiple SSN
clusters are neighbors to members of the same Pfam family and, therefore, may
have the same in vitro activities and in vivo metabolic functions.

Files</p>

<p>The Download Page also provides links for downloading</p>

<p>1. Text file containing all the UniProt IDs in the SSN, the color assigned to the
    ID, and the cluster number that the ID belongs to.</p>

<p>2. A compressed zip file containing files for each cluster that list the UniProt IDs.</p>

<p>3. A compressed zip file containing all of the FASTA sequences for each UniProt ID
    in the input SSN.</p>

<p>4. A compressed zip file containing all of the neighbors for each Pfam cluster in the
    GNNs.</p>

<p>5. A compressed zip file containing files for each cluster that list the neighbors
    of sequences in the input SSN that do not have Pfams assigned.</p>

<p>6. Text file with list of query accession IDs not found in the bacterial and
    fungal ENA files as well as those that do not have genome neighbors.</p>

<h3>Colored SSN for EAL SBP Cluster</h3>

<p>The colored SSN for the input EAL SBP SSN with the unique cluster colors and
numbers is shown in Figure 5 (a single, uniformly colored cluster). It is
identical to the input SSN (Figure 3b) except the nodes are uniformly colored.
The input EAL SBP SSN did not contain any singletons—only a single multi-node cluster. If
singletons are present in the input SSN, they are not used for neighbor
identification; however, they are included in the GNN with the Cytoscape
default color (cyan).</p>

<h3>Genome Neighborhood Network (GNN) for EAL SBP Cluster, Pfam family hub-nodes and SSN cluster spoke-nodes</h3>

<p>The GNN with Pfam family hub-nodes and SSN cluster spoke-nodes is shown in
Figure 6A. This GNN was generated with the default &plusmn;10 orf window and a 5% co-occurrence frequency; it has 31 clusters with hub-nodes for the Pfam families
for genome neighbors. The cluster with the largest spoke-nodes contains
information about neighbors not assigned to Pfam families--~20% of the proteins
in UniProt are not assigned to a Pfam family.</p>

<p><img src='images/tutorial/example_figure_6.jpg' width='600'></p>
<p><i>Figure 6.</i> Pfam family hub-node GNN filtered with increasing co-occurrence
frequency.</p>

<p>The 5% co-occurrence frequency GNN was filtered to identify the clusters
associated with query-neighbor co-occurrence frequencies &ge; 10%; this GNN has 14
clusters with hub-nodes for the Pfam families for genome neighbors (Figure 6B).</p>

<p>The 10% co-occurrence frequency GNN was filtered to identify the clusters
associated with query-neighbor co-occurrence frequencies &ge; 20%; this GNN has 9
clusters with hub-nodes for the Pfam families for genome neighbors as well as
the two other components of the transport system (DctQ and DctM) and
transcriptional regulators (Figure 6C/6D). Whereas the enzymes in pathways
often, but not always, are conserved in pathways, the transcriptional
regulators usually are not. Thus, multiple Pfam families may be present for
different transcriptional regulators.</p>

<p>The clusters for the no Pfam cluster and the clusters associated with transport
system components and transcriptional regulators were deleted from the 20% co-
occurrence frequency GNN. The resulting GNN has 4 clusters with hub-nodes for
the Pfam families for genome neighbors (Figure 6E):</p>

<p>1. Gln-synth_C, PF00120, glutamine synthase family</p>
<p>2. Fe-ADH, PF00465, Fe-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase family</p>
<p>3. Aldeh, PF00171, aldehyde dehydrogenase family</p>
<p>4. FGase, PF05013, formylglutamate hydrolase family</p>

<p>These Pfam families can be used to infer a catabolic pathway for EAL, the SBP
ligand (Figure 7).</p>

<h3>Genome Neighborhood Network (GNN) for EAL SBP Cluster, SSN cluster hub-nodes and Pfam family spoke-nodes</h3>

<p>The complementary GNN with the EAL SBP SSN cluster hub-node and Pfam family
spoke-nodes is shown in Figure 8A. This cluster has a single hub-node and 31
Pfam family spoke-nodes.</p>

<p><img src='images/tutorial/example_figure_8.jpg' width='600'></p>
<p><i>Figure 8.</i> SSN cluster hub-node GNN filtered with increasing co-occurrence
frequency.</p>

<p>The 5% co-occurrence frequency GNN was filtered to identify the Pfam spoke-nodes associated with co-occurrence frequencies &ge; 10%; this GNN has 14 spoke-
nodes for the Pfam families for genome neighbors (Figure 8B).</p>

<p>The 10% co-occurrence frequency GNN was filtered to identify the clusters
associated with co-occurrence frequencies &ge; 20%; this GNN has 9 spoke-nodes for
the Pfam families for genome neighbors as well as the other components of the
transport system and transcriptional regulators (Figure 8C).</p>

<p>The clusters for the no Pfam cluster and the clusters associated with transport
system components and transcriptional regulators were deleted from the 20% co-
occurrence frequency GNN. The resulting GNN has 4 spoke-nodes for the Pfam
families for genome neighbors (Figure 8D):</p>

<p><ol>
	<li>1. Gln-synth_C, PF00120, glutamine synthase family</li>
	<li>2. Fe-ADH, PF00465, Fe-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase family</li>
	<li>3. Aldeh, PF00171, aldehyde dehydrogenase family</li>
	<li>4. FGase, PF05013, formylglutamate hydrolase family</li>
</ol></p>

<p>As described in the a previous section of the tutorial, the node attributes for
the hub-nodes and spoke-nodes contain information about query-neighbor mean and
median distances as well as the co-occurrence frequencies (decimal fraction and
ratio of neighbors/queriable sequences).</p>


<h3>Mapping genome neighbors to Pfam family SSNs</h3>

<p>A spreadsheet file is available for download that will allow the genome neighbors
in the various Pfam families to be mapped using the color of the cluster in the
colored SSN to the SSNs for their Pfam families (#8 in the list of text/
spreadsheet files listed above).The columns in the spreadsheet can be added as
custom node attributes to the SSN using the BridgeDB application in Cytoscape.</p>

<p>Figure 9 shows the mapping of the neighbors to the SSNs for PF00120 (Panel A;
Gln-synth_C), PF00465 (Panel B; Fe-ADH), PF00171 (Panel C; Aldeh), and PF05013
(Panel D; FGase).</p>

<p><img src='images/tutorial/example_figure_9.jpg' width='600'></p>

<p><i>Figure 9.</i> SSNs of genome neighborhood Pfam families. Panel A: PF00120; Gln-
synth_C; alignment score 100. Panel B: PF00465; Fe-ADH; alignment score 100.
Panel C: PF00171; Aldeh; alignment score 170. Panel D: PF05013; FGase;
alignment score 65.</p>

<p>Notice that the mapping of the neighbors to these Pfam family SSNs facilitates
selection of alignment scores to segregate the families into isofunctional
clusters, i.e., multiple isofunctional sequences populate clusters in the SSN
so that the user is more informed in decided an appropriate alignment score.</p>

<p>Also, not all nodes in the SSN clusters with neighbors of the EAL-binding SBP
are colored—the enzymes in catabolic pathways are frequently conserved
phylogenetically. However, the transport systems (and transcriptional
regulators) often are not conserved, so the nodes in the SSNs that are adjacent
to other transport systems would not be colored.</p>



<h3>Multiple neighbors of the same large Pfam family in the genome neighborhood</h3>

<p>Some enzyme Pfam families are large, e.g., PF00171, the aldehyde dehydrogenase
superfamily has 138,202 sequences in UniProt 2016_06. As a result, a &plusmn;10 orf
genome neighborhood may contain a functionally related member of the large
family as well as one (or more) "random", functionally unrelated member(s). Using the SSN for
PF00171 as an example, the neighbors identified by the EAL-binding SBP cluster
were colored red in Figure 9C; the penultimate enzyme in the catabolic pathway
for EAL is an aldehyde dehydrogenase from PF00171 that generates g-L-glutamyl-glycine
from g-L-glutamyl-aminoacetaldehyde.</p>

<p>The spreadsheet used in the previous section for coloring the genome neighbors
of the SSN queries also contains the absolute values of the query-neighbor
distances. The Select Control Panel can be used to identify the nodes in the
SSN that have user-specified values for the query-neighbor distance. In Figure
10, nodes in the SSN in Figure 9C that are &ge;5 orfs from the queries are colored
blue. All but two of the 12 remote sequences are second occurrences of PF00171
in the genome neighborhood of the EAL-binding SBP queries (determined by
sorting the spreadsheet used to generate the custom node attributes). Thus, the
query-neighbor distance information in the downloadable spreadsheet/custom node
attribute can be used to identify functionally unrelated occurrences of
multiple members of a neighbor Pfam family.</p>
